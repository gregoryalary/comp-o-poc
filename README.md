# Comp-O for assisted composite service building and automatic generation of composite service descriptions

This repository contains a POC showing how we can use the [Comp-O](https://gregoryalary.github.io/comp-o/) ontology to assist developer in the building of composite services and to automatically generate theirs descriptions.

Several component-based service descriptions that can be used to test this POC are available in `resources/in`.

### Features

- Listing of the available services
- Listing of the required interfaces of a component-based service
- Check of the compatibility between a required interface and a service
- Automatic generation of composite service descriptions
